I have a background in Economics, and am now a Master student in Politics and Social Policy at the University of Bologna. In addition to my research activities at university, I am also involved with the association *una Regione per Restare* (RxR) as head of their Social Observatory.

Due to my mixed background, I can count on solid foundations in data analysis and econometrics, as well as on extensive domain knowledge in social sciences.

My main research interests revolve around social stratification and material inequality, but the *Projects* section of this site will also accommodate some of my less "serious" work, as well as some teaching material.
